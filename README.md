# How to use my edit of this! 
I left everything backwards compatible so you can still use it like before with just 
```lua
exports["boostinghack"]:StartHack()
-- With my edit there is 2 new options you can use if you leave blank it will randomize like before!
-- new Options are -- 
-- diff = 'easy' -- 'medium' -- 'hard' -- 'expert'
-- time = 20 -- IN SECONDS not MS 
--- Example 
exports["boostinghack"]:StartHack('expert', 10) -- this will start expert hack(Harder Symbols)
-- THIS does Randomize what symbols it will give you sometimes you still have a small chance of getting easy symbols still! Most the time its only about a 10% chance of getting easier ones on hard/expert. 

```
